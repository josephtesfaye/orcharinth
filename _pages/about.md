Hi, I’m Joseph Huang. Welcome to Orcharinth!

This is a space where the structured complexity of the Labyrinth meets the
organic growth of the Orchard. It is a digital grove planted at the intersection
of logic and life—a place to wander through the winding paths of programming and
science, to rest among the fruit of music, cinema, and literature, and to
cultivate the vital roots of health and daily thought.

Why Orcharinth?

I believe that knowledge is rarely found on a straight, paved road. It is a
Labyrinth—complex, winding, and sometimes confusing—but when tended to like an
Orchard, it yields something nourishing. This blog is my way of mapping those
paths.

What I’m Cultivating Here:

- The Logic: Deep dives into programming, technical puzzles, and the latest in
  scientific discovery.

- The Soul: Reflections on the movies that move me, the books that change me,
  and the music that provides the soundtrack to it all.

- The Machine: Notes on health, bio-optimization, and the physical discipline of
  fitness.

- The Daily Drift: Casual thoughts, life lessons, and the "bugs" I’m currently
  fixing in my own perspective.

By day, I'm a software engineer. By night, I wander the Orcharinth. I’m a firm
believer that the best way to understand the world is to stay curious about all
of it, not just one slice.

I’m glad you’ve found your way into the grove. Let’s see what’s growing.
